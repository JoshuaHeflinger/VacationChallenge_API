The purpose of this challenge was to find the best places to travel that you could drive between that all fit the criteria. This was done by using the geoapify api. We were able to shorten our lists of places to visit by using filtering it by cities that had hotels and ones that were between 70 and 90 degrees. From there we picked a country and created a path that would be accessable.
